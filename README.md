## KNN-Classification-using-Iris-Dataset
#This segment of code deals with understanding K-Nearest Neighbours classification method and implement it using the Iris Dataset<br>
<br>1. First, load the Iris Dataset, which contains the data(data to learn), target(classification labels), target_names(meaning of the labels), feature_names(meaning of the features) and DESCR(full description of the dataset).<br>
<br>2. Once loaded, we take the first two features in order to easily visualize the results.<br>
<br>3. Now, we build and train a K-NN model with k=3(number of neighbours).<br>
<br>4. Next, find the k-neighbours of a point.<br>
<br>5. Now, find the K-neighbours of all points in the trainig dataset<br>
<br>6. Computed the weighed graph of K-neighbours for points in X(complete training set).<br>
<br>7. Now, visualize the decision boundary with a step size of  0.02 in the mesh and create color maps.<br>
<br>8. Fit the model by creating an instance of Neighbours Classifier.<br>
<br>9. Plot the decision boundary and plot the result into a color plot.<br>
<br> 10. Additionally, we can perform Nearest Neighbours method to solve a regression problem.<br>
<br> 11. Fit the regression model, plot the results.<br>
